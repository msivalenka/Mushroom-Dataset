This is the repository for the ML algorithms that I have written using the Mushroom Dataset. I have downloaded the data from Kaggle. The same is available in this repository.
The main agenda of my algorithm is to predict whether a mushroom is poisonous or non-poisonous based on factors that are provided as columns in the data set.
The target variable is "class".
As you can see in the Notebook, I have used the popular Unsupervised Learning algorithm called "K-Means" to predict whether the mushrooms are poisonous or non-poisonous.
